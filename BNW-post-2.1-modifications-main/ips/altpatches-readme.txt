-coreography (Sir Fig Newton)

Restructures the Dance command, breaking each biome's list of steps up into two categories: transition steps and sustain steps.
Transition steps are those that can be chosen from when you dance a new background.
Sustain steps are those that can be chosen when you choose a dance that matches the current background
There are 2 steps in each category, with probabilities as follows:
Transition steps: 75%/25%
