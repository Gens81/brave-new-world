-choreography (Sir Fig Newton)

Restructures the Dance command, breaking each biome's list of steps up into two categories: transition steps and sustain steps.
Transition steps are those that can be chosen from when you dance a new background.
Sustain steps are those that can be chosen when you choose a dance that matches the current background.
There are 2 steps in each category, with probabilities as follows:
Transition steps: 75%/25%
Sustain steps: 60%/40%
Dance status is no longer persistent under any circumstances. Instead, the Moogle Charm removes stumble rates entirely.
