These are Lua scripts made by Serity. They are meant to be used on a specific PC emulator called Snes9x-rr 1.60, that is downloadable at:
https://github.com/gocha/snes9x-rr/releases

With the game running, 
select File>Lua Scripting>New Lua script Window...

and than select "Browse..." and search for the .lua file you want to load


Instructions:

-- ========= BNW Bestiary ========= --
--  * Bestiary. L when at the main menu, or while paused in combat.
--    When in combat, it will only show the enemies in the current fight.
--    When at the main menu, it will show every enemy in the game. Beware spoilers!
--  * Switch bestiary pages with Y. Scroll with any d-pad direction. Close with B.

-- ========= BNW Rage Battle Display ========= --
--  Each rage description will be automatically shown in the upper left part of the screen, while scrolling the battle menu.

If you want to use them together, just open another Lua script Window.
