# Upcoming

### 2.2 roadmap (ordered by priority):

- Add char elemental properties to the status menu
- Press A on a Rage to show details: Elemental weaknesses/resistance, Statuses immunities/innate
- Compress title screen graphic and/or import Snaphat compression algorythm
- Phoenix glitch fix
- List equips in the equip screen by descending price (unique items - marked by 1 GP selling value - are always on top)
- Import Alphabetical Lore by Silent Enigma: useless for english version but useful for translations or future lores edits
- Disintegration animation for enemies that get petrified

### Events
- When Lockes leaves the party in Returners Hideout
	(Locke leaves in the wrong direction)
	Edgar: "Uh, Locke..."
	Locke: "Right."
	(Leaves in the right direction)
	Sabin: "...what do you see in that guy?"
- Banon's death reference at the end of Thamasa events 
	Terra: Where's Banon?
	Edgar: (head down) He... didn't make it out.
	Sabin: At least we get to keep playing though, amirite?
- Restore Shadow cutscene during Soul train fight
- Add "CT - Mistery from the past" track to Ultima's sealed door

### "Bro new world" features candidates for porting:
- Allow Esper menu to open "Curative Ally Targeting" submenu
- No longer show damage on Interceptor
- If "Fight" will yield a desperation attack, the text is yellow 
- Scan anytime (HP/MP accessible via X, Status via Y, weaknesses and AI hints via scan)
- Enemy script changes shown in message boxes (eg. "Disabled")
- Status tick rate not affected by speed/haste/slow
- Defend work against piercing (ignore defense) attacks
- Dog Block and Golem preempt check for cover
- Smart targeting
	Random targeting behaves differently 50% of the time
	If setting/toggling status, selects target without the status
	If lifting status, select target with the status
	If damaging/healing, selects near fatal target

### Bugfixes/features temporarily discarded:
- Stuck in a pose (walking pose in events like npc unequip)
- Bird bars (setzer position after bar-bar-bar palidor)
