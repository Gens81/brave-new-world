# Upcoming

### 2.2 roadmap:
- Added cut for Shift dances?
- Add bnw dev names to credits
- revert Phunbaba to 2 chars blown away (to balance Terra being equippable)
- killing soulblazers being no more a win condition (to balance Cyan joining wrexsoul)
- Fix dual wield penalty shown regardless of whether you're using a second weapon
- Fix Phantasm (hp leak) being stronger on chars with higher stamina
- Fix Near Fatal hack bugs (or leave it out)
- Power/target alt description 
- Allow summon menu to open "Curative Ally Targeting" submenu
- Add Brave New World subtitle to the ingame animated title
- Import Alphabetical Lore by Silent Enigma: useless for english version but useful for translations or future lores edits

- Disintegration animation for enemies that get petrified

### "Bro new world" features to port:
- If "Fight" will yield a desperation attack, the text is yellow 
- Scan anytime (HP/MP accessible via X, Status via Y, elemental properties and AI hints via Scan)
- Status tick rate not affected by speed/haste/slow
- Defend work against piercing (ignore defense) attacks
- Dog Block and Golem preempt check for cover
- Smart targeting
	Random targeting behaves differently 50% of the time
