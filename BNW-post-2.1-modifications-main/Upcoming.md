# Upcoming

### 2.2 roadmap:
- Press A on a Rage to show details: Elemental weaknesses/resistance, Statuses immunities/innate
- Compact spells list on field menu
- Fixed dual wield penalty shown regardless of whether you're using a second weapon
- Fixed "If Near Fatal causes Zinger to be removed from a target, any remaining strikes will target whoever is in the 2nd slot"
- Added Brave New World subtitle to the ingame animated title
- Allow Esper menu to open "Curative Ally Targeting" submenu
- Import Alphabetical Lore by Silent Enigma: useless for english version but useful for translations or future lores edits
- Phoenix glitch fix
- Disintegration animation for enemies that get petrified
- Import Snaphat compression algorythm

### Events
- Restore Shadow cutscene during Soul train fight
- Banon's death reference at the end of Thamasa events 
	Terra: Where's Banon?
	Edgar: (head down) He_<D> didn't make it out.
- Add "CT - Mistery from the past" track to Ultima's sealed door
- Add Esper portrait to the menu before Phunbaba 3rd fight

### "Bro new world" features candidates for porting:
- If "Fight" will yield a desperation attack, the text is yellow 
- Scan anytime (HP/MP accessible via X, Status via Y, weaknesses and AI hints via scan)
- Enemy script changes shown in message boxes (eg. "Disabled")
- Status tick rate not affected by speed/haste/slow
- Defend work against piercing (ignore defense) attacks
- Dog Block and Golem preempt check for cover
- Smart targeting
	Random targeting behaves differently 50% of the time
	If setting/toggling status, selects target without the status
	If lifting status, select target with the status
	If damaging/healing, selects near fatal target

### Bugfixes/features temporarily discarded:
- Stuck in a pose (walking pose in events like npc unequip)
- Bird bars (setzer position after bar-bar-bar palidor)
- Banon riding chocobo pose 
- Imperial camp dialogue fix (sabin aware of doma without speaking to Shadow)
- Bottom shadow for menu letters q,p,g,y,j
- Oceanic line anomaly

### BIB ideas:
- Rods consume MP only when procs spells
- Physical blitzes can crit
- Remove 1 fight in IAF and/or Mine Cart
- Magitek rided by humans are stealable
- Remove Siren from BAR-BAR-BAR pool
- Gray out null values on shop details menu
- Raise Slow accuracy

### Long-term goals (3.0?):
- Colosseum overhaul
- Multiparty FC
