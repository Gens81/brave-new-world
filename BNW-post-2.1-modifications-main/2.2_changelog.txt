2.2 roadmap (ordered by priority):

- Pressing on an esper twice remove it, pressing on an esper equipped on another char makes you choose if you want to "steal" it
- Tweak battle inventory to show only usable items (consumables and rods) in the main item screen and only equippable pieces in the equip submenu
- Import Rage checklist (Assassin): an hack that shows in gray, rages unlocked into the Veldt but not yet "leaped"
- Press A on a Rage to show details: Elemental weaknesses/resistance, Statuses immunities/innate (this would be useless if we build a complete bestiary)
- Summon command active with X-Magic (needs an hacker working on it)
- Autoscan feature - press Y to see HP/MP, X for statuses - Scan is still needed for weaknesses (depends on Bropedio)
- Import Alphabetical Lore (Silent Enigma): useless for english version but useful for translations or future lores edits
- Fix mp colors corrupting reflect palette (Ryo_Hazuki) [very low priority - can stay as it is now]
