Events
- When Lockes leaves the party in Returners Hideout
	(Locke leaves in the wrong direction)
	Edgar: "Uh, Locke..."
	Locke: "Right."
	(Leaves in the right direction)
	Sabin: "...what do you see in that guy?"
- Add "CT - Mistery from the past" track to Ultima's sealed door
- Add the clear bytes to Red-D, Silver-D and White-D events (as it happens already for Blue-D, to avoid invisible obstacles on map after killing them)
- Add a battle dialogue when you trigger elixir counter vs Magimaster (and/or a NPC line about dispel utility)
- Banon's death reference at the end of Thamasa events 
	Terra: Where's Banon?
	Edgar: <head down>He... didn't make it out.
	Sabin: At least we get to keep playing though, amirite?
- Restore Shadow cutscene during Soul train fight

"Bro new world" features candidates for porting:
- If "Fight" will yield a desperation attack, the text is yellow 
- Scan anytime (HP/MP accessible via X, Status via Y, weaknesses and AI hints via scan)
- Enemy script changes shown in message boxes (eg. "Disabled)
- No longer show damage on Interceptor
- Fix sprite priority bug after covering
- Status tick rate not affected by speed/haste/slow
- Defend work against piercing (ignore defense) attacks
- Dog Block and Golem preempt check for cover
- # Smart targeting
	Random targeting behaves differently 50% of the time
	If setting/toggling status, selects target without the status
	If lifting status, select target with the status
	If damaging/healing, selects near fatal target

Bugfixes/features temporarily discarded:
- Bird bars (setzer position after bar-bar-bar palidor)
- Banon riding chocobo pose 
- Imperial camp dialogue fix (sabin aware of doma without speaking to Shadow)

BIB ideas:
- Rods don't consume MP on non critical attacks
- Physical blitzes can crit
- Mana battery power raised from 1 to 2
- Remove 1 fight in IAF and/or Mine Cart
- Magitek rided by humans are stealable

Long-term goals (3.0?):
Colosseum overhaul
Multiparty FC
