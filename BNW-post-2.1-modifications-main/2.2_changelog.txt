2.2 roadmap (ordered by priority):

- Import Rage checklist (Assassin): a hack that shows in gray, rages unlocked into the Veldt but not yet "leaped"
- Press A on a Rage to show details: Elemental weaknesses/resistance, Statuses immunities/innate
- Summon command active with X-Magic
- Import Alphabetical Lore by Silent Enigma: useless for english version but useful for translations or future lores edits

2.2 side-notes (a sort of wishlist, good ideas notes):

- Fix mp colors corrupting reflect palette (Ryo_Hazuki) (very low priority, can stay as it is now)
- Rods don't consume MP on non critical attacks??
- Phoenix glitch fix
- Double Meteor fix in Kefka fight
- Add the clear bytes to Red-D, Silver-D and White-D events (to avoid invisible obstacles on map)
- full heal at party menu after zozo events??
- Get rid of lag in shop menu
- add a battle dialogue when you trigger elixir counter vs Magimaster (and/or a NPC line about dispel utility)
- Disintegration animation for enemies that get petrified
- Banon's death reference during Thamasa events (we can keep playing, amirite?)
- move the relic tutorial scene after gogo recruitment to advice about commands customization in status menu
- make fast animations by Sarah Shinespark default??

?? = things that needs to be discussed/approved by BTB

Bro new world features candidates for porting:

- scan anytime (HP/MP accessible via X, Status via Y, weaknesses via scan)
- If "Fight" will yield a desperation attack, the text is yellow
- Blitz uses a special "merged" button press byte -- combining controller 1 and controller 2. Block controller 2 Blitz input.
- Prevent using slim jim from field menu
- Prevent using Red bull on already-floating character from field menu
- Status tick rate not affected by speed/haste/slow
- Defend work against piercing (ignore defense) attacks
- Dog Block and Golem preempt check for cover
- no longer show damage on Interceptor
- # Smart targeting
	Random targeting behaves differently 50% of the time
	If setting/toggling status, selects target without the status
	If lifting status, select target with the status
	If damaging/healing, selects near fatal target

Other ideas:

- Mana battery power raised from 1 to 2
- red-colored counters (check if it's possible to use the code to color in red battle quote just for counter abilities used by the enemy)
- status icons on status screen (use the space available near to the name to add status icons to list innate buffs)

Long-term goals:

Colosseum overhaul
Multiparty FC
