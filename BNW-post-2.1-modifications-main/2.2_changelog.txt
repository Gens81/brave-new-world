2.2 roadmap (ordered by priority):

- Import Rage checklist (Assassin): a hack that shows in gray, rages unlocked into the Veldt but not yet "leaped"
- Press A on a Rage to show details: Elemental weaknesses/resistance, Statuses immunities/innate
- Summon command active with X-Magic
- Compress title screen graphic
- Show description by default in equip menu (no y pressing)
- Import Alphabetical Lore by Silent Enigma: useless for english version but useful for translations or future lores edits

2.2 side-notes (a sort of wishlist, good ideas notes):

- Add "CT - Mistery from the past" track to Ultima's sealed door
- Fix mp colors corrupting reflect palette (Ryo_Hazuki) (very low priority, can stay as it is now)
- Rods don't consume MP on non critical attacks
- Phoenix glitch fix
- Double Meteor fix in Kefka fight
- Add the clear bytes to Red-D, Silver-D and White-D events (to avoid invisible obstacles on map)
- Full heal at party menu after zozo events
- Get rid of lag in shop menu
- Add a battle dialogue when you trigger elixir counter vs Magimaster (and/or a NPC line about dispel utility)
- Disintegration animation for enemies that get petrified
- Banon's death reference during Thamasa events (we can keep playing, amirite?)
- Move the relic tutorial scene after gogo recruitment to advice about commands customization in status menu

Bro new world features candidates for porting:

- Scan anytime (HP/MP accessible via X, Status via Y, weaknesses via scan)
- If "Fight" will yield a desperation attack, the text is yellow
- Status tick rate not affected by speed/haste/slow
- Defend work against piercing (ignore defense) attacks
- Dog Block and Golem preempt check for cover
- No longer show damage on Interceptor
- # Smart targeting
	Random targeting behaves differently 50% of the time
	If setting/toggling status, selects target without the status
	If lifting status, select target with the status
	If damaging/healing, selects near fatal target

Other ideas:
- Mana battery power raised from 1 to 2
- Status icons on status screen (next to the name) to show the innate buffs
- Physical blitzes can crit

Bugfixes temporarily discarded:
- bird bars (setzer position after bar-bar-bar palidor)
- banon riding chocobo pose

Long-term goals:
Colosseum overhaul
Multiparty FC
