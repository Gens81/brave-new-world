2.2 roadmap (ordered by priority):

- Press A on a Rage to show details: Elemental weaknesses/resistance, Statuses immunities/innate
- Compress title screen graphic
- Import Alphabetical Lore by Silent Enigma: useless for english version but useful for translations or future lores edits

2.2 side-notes (a sort of wishlist, good ideas notes):

- Add "CT - Mistery from the past" track to Ultima's sealed door
- Add the clear bytes to Red-D, Silver-D and White-D events (to avoid invisible obstacles on map after killing them)
- Add a battle dialogue when you trigger elixir counter vs Magimaster (and/or a NPC line about dispel utility)
- Disintegration animation for enemies that get petrified
- Banon's death reference during Thamasa events (we can keep playing, amirite?)
- Phoenix glitch fix
- Double Meteor fix in Kefka fight
- Throw menu stops scrolling after 21 lines

"Bro new world" features candidates for porting:

- Scan anytime (HP/MP accessible via X, Status via Y, weaknesses via scan)
- If "Fight" will yield a desperation attack, the text is yellow
- Status tick rate not affected by speed/haste/slow
- Defend work against piercing (ignore defense) attacks
- Dog Block and Golem preempt check for cover
- No longer show damage on Interceptor
- # Smart targeting
	Random targeting behaves differently 50% of the time
	If setting/toggling status, selects target without the status
	If lifting status, select target with the status
	If damaging/healing, selects near fatal target

Bugfixes temporarily discarded:
- Bird bars (setzer position after bar-bar-bar palidor)
- Banon riding chocobo pose 
- Imperial camp dialogue fix (sabin aware of doma without speaking to Shadow)

Other ideas:
- Innate buffs recap on the status screen (next to the name) 
- Rods don't consume MP on non critical attacks
- Physical blitzes can crit
- Mana battery power raised from 1 to 2

Long-term goals (3.0?):
Colosseum overhaul
Multiparty FC
