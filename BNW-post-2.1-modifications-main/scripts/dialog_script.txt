Biggs: There's the city. <D24><EOP>
Wedge: It's hard to believe an esper's been found intact there a thousand years after the War of the Magi_ <D24>

[caption #1]
Biggs: Think it's still alive? <D24><EOP>
Wedge: Probably, judging from the urgency of our orders. <D24>

[caption #2]
Biggs: What about this_ <D>this witch? <D>Why did we have to bring her? <D24><EOP>
Biggs: I heard she fried fifty of our Magitek Armored soldiers in just a few minutes. <D>I don't know if I want her along_ <D24>

[caption #3]
Wedge: Relax. The slave crown on her head robs her of all conscious thought. <D>She'll follow orders. <D24>

[caption #4]
Wedge: We'll approach from the east. <D>Move out! <D12>

[caption #5]
    Long ago, the War of the Magi
        reduced the world to a
    scorched wasteland, and magic
        simply ceased to exist. <E$FF><OP$12>

[caption #6]
   A thousand years have passed.
     Iron, gunpowder, and steam
      engines have all emerged,
     and high technology reigns_ <E$FF><OP$12>

[caption #7]
        But there are some who
      would enslave the world by
    reviving the dread destructive
        force known as [magic]. <E$FF><OP$12>

[caption #8]
           Can it be that those
     in power are on the verge of
          repeating a senseless
           and deadly mistake? <E$2A><OP$12>

[caption #9]


[caption #10]
Wedge: Let's put her on point. No sense taking any risks. <D>Forward!

[caption #11]

         [NO! <D>BAD PLAYER!]

[caption #12]
Imperial Magitek Armor? Not even Narshe is safe anymore!

[caption #13]
Imperial bastards!

[caption #14]
Your kind is not welcome here!

[caption #15]
Wedge: According to our source, the esper was found frozen under a new mine shaft. <D>This must be it_

[caption #16]
Biggs: Stand back, I've got this.

[caption #17]
We've got 'em trapped!

[caption #18]
We must defend the mines!

[caption #19]
Locked.

[caption #20]
Girl: Where am I_?

[caption #21]
Man: Whoa! And I only just removed the crown!<EOP>
Girl: My head_ <D>hurts_

[caption #22]
Man: Easy! This is a slave crown. Those soldiers had complete control over you.

[caption #23]
Girl: I can't remember a thing_<EOP>
Man: Don't worry. It'll all come back to you in time.

[caption #24]
Girl: My name_ <D>is <A0>_<EOP>
Man: Wow! I've never heard of anyone recovering this fast!

[caption #25]
Open up! Give us the girl that was riding the Magitek Armor!

[caption #26]
We're here for the girl! She's an officer of the Empire!

[caption #27]
<A0>: Empire_? Magitek Armor_?

[caption #28]
Man: Oh, no_ <D>you have to get out of here! I don't have time to explain!

[caption #29]
Man: Over here!

[caption #30]
A mysterious young woman, controlled by the Empire, and born with the gift of magic_

[caption #31]


[caption #32]
Man: Make your way out through the mines! I'll keep these fools occupied!

[caption #33]
There she is!

[caption #34]
She's up there!

[caption #35]
Kefka: My sweet little witch! Uwee hee hee! With this slave crown you'll be mine to do with as I see fit!

[caption #36]


[caption #37]
Gestahl: Soldiers of the Empire, we stand on the brink of a new era!<EOP>
Gestahl: In the days to come, we will witness the complete revival of magic!<EOP>
Gestahl: It is our destiny, and ours alone, to take this mystic force and claim what is rightfully ours!

[caption #38]


[caption #39]
Gestahl: With our new-found power, nothing shall stand in our way!<EOP>
[Hurrah!]

[caption #40]
Man: Took you long enough! How goes the robbing and plundering trade?

[caption #41]
<A1>: I PREFER the term [treasure hunting]!<EOP>
Man: Ha! Semantic nonsense!<EOP>
<A1>: There's a huge difference!

[caption #42]
<A1>: Anyway, you sent for me?<EOP>
Man: Yeah. There's a girl I'd like you to meet.

[caption #43]
<A1>: You don't mean_

[caption #44]
Man: The city guard is pursuing her as we speak.<EOP>
Man: I tried to explain that the Empire was controlling her, but they wouldn't even listen.

[caption #45]
<A1>: Sounds like she could use our help.

[caption #46]
Man: She's escaped into the mines, but there's no telling how long she can hide.<EOP>
Man: Rescue her, then make your way to Figaro. The king should be able to help.<EOP>
Man: I'll stay here and try to convince the townspeople to see some reason.<EOP>
Man: Narshe has the strength to stand up to the Empire, but they refuse to join a resistance group like the Returners.

[caption #47]
Treasure hunter and trail-worn traveler, searching the world over for relics of the past_

[caption #48]
Now we've got her!

Need help?

Your objective is to defeat the commander before his men reach <A0>.<EOP>
And don't steal my spear - I need it to defend myself. <D>Go buy your own, kupo.

[caption #55]
<A0>: Unh_

[caption #56]
<A1>: Thanks, moogles! We're in your debt!

[caption #57]

<A0>: Ugh_ I can't remember anything_

[caption #61]
<A1>: You have amnesia!?

[caption #62]
<A0>: A man said my memory would come back_<EOP>
<A1>: Give it time. You're safe with me! I give you my word!<EOP>
<A0>: _?<EOP>
<A1>: Trust me! I won't leave you until your memory returns!

[caption #63]
King: You mean, this is the young woman_?

[caption #64]
<A0>: Who are you?

[caption #65]
King: Oh, my apologies!

[caption #66]
King: How rude of me to turn my back to a lady!

[caption #67]
The young king of Figaro Castle, ally to the Empire, and a master designer of machinery_

[caption #68]
<A4>: I am <A4>, the king of Figaro.

[caption #69]
<A1>: Surprised someone like me knows a king?

[caption #70]
<A1>: Catch you two later!

[caption #71]
<A4>: So_ you're an Imperial soldier? <D>No problem. Figaro and the Empire are allies.<EOP>
<A4>: Please relax while you're here. It's not in my blood to harm a lady.

[caption #72]
<A0>: _why are you being so kind to me? Is it because of my_ <D>abilities?

[caption #73]
<A4>: I'll give you three reasons. First of all, your beauty has captivated me.<EOP>
<A4>: Second, I'm dying to know if I'm your type.

[caption #74]
<A4>: I guess your_ <D>abilities_ would be a distant third.

[caption #75]
<A0>: _?

[caption #76]
<A4>: <D>Guess my technique's getting a bit rusty_

[caption #77]
<A4>: Come find me when you feel rested.

[caption #78]
<A0>: I suppose a normal girl would have found him dashing. <D>But_ <D>I'm hardly normal_

[caption #79]
Feel free to wander about.

[caption #80]
Go see the king!

[caption #81]
Julian: One day, I'll be a master engineer just like king <A4>.

[caption #82]
Long ago, a force known as [magic] existed. Those who used it were called sorcerers.

[caption #83]
Scholars the world over are doing research on magic.

[caption #84]
_you actually FOUND the lost city of El Dorito? Amazing!

[caption #85]
I heard the Empire is using something called [Magitek_]

[caption #86]
The Empire has sacked the three cities on the southern continent. Just a matter of time till they come up here_

[caption #87]
I hear that Emperor Gestahl has harnessed the power of magic.

[caption #88]
<A4> is a good king, and a decent enough man_<EOP>
_but if he asks you if you'd like to see the [King's Spear], tell him no.

[caption #89]
His highness said he'd marry me when I get older!

[caption #90]
I wanna marry the king!

[caption #91]
<A4> will hit on anything with a pulse. Surely he's made a pass at you?

[caption #92]
<A0>: _

[caption #93]
Oh_ <D>hi, <A4>.

[caption #94]
_

[caption #95]


[caption #96]
This is the jail.

[caption #97]
I demand to see <A4>! How dare they keep us in this urine-soaked hellhole!

[caption #98]
Let us outta here!

[caption #99]
We're nothing compared to the real threat lurking out there, and King <A4> knows it!

[caption #100]
I'm Lone Wolf, the treasure hunter!

[caption #101]
Monica: Also, have you met Chancellor Mikhail? He's my younger brother.

[caption #102]
Monica: Hello. I am Monica, high priestess of Figaro and matron to the royal family.<EOP>
Monica: <A4> has a twin brother. It's such a shame what happened_

[caption #103]
Boy: <A4>, what's wrong with father? What's all this talk of his successor?<EOP>
<A4>: Are you blind? Look how thin his face has become!

[caption #104]
Boy: _? <D>What are you talking about?

[caption #105]
Boy: <A4>!

[caption #106]
Boy: Are you_ <D>crying?

[caption #107]
<A4>'s twin brother, who traded the throne for his own freedom_

[caption #108]
Monica: Ah_ <A5>. <D>Oh, he looked so like his father!<EOP>
Monica: He was such a sweet child_ <D>I often wonder what he's like now.

[caption #109]
Mikhail: <A5> found the whole business of the succession so repugnant that he fled the castle forever.<EOP>
Mikhail: The story goes that it was all settled with a coin toss.

[caption #110]
Merchant: I can't take money from the king!<EOP>
<A4>: Don't you have a family to feed? Just take it.

[caption #111]
Merchant: Sir <A5>, I can't take your money!<EOP>
<A5>: Sure you can. I mean, everyone's gotta eat, right?

[caption #112]
<A4>: You've been busy down south! Looking for more cities to destroy?<EOP>
Trooper: That's for us to know!

[caption #113]
Sir Kefka? What brings you-<EOP>
Kefka: Outta my way!

[caption #114]
<A4>: Well? How do you like my castle?

[caption #115]
King <A4>! A general of the Empire has requested an audience with you!

[caption #116]
<A4>: Probably Kefka!

[caption #117]
Kefka: Emperor Gestahl's stupid orders_

[caption #118]
Kefka: What kind of idiot builds a castle in the middle of nowhere? <D>How inconsiderate!

[caption #119]
Kefka: Ahem_ <D>there's SAND on my boots!

[caption #120]
Yes, sir! All set, sir!

[caption #121]
Kefka: Snivelling doormats!

[caption #122]
<A4>: I thought we were allies! What are you doing in my domain?<EOP>
Soldier: Allies? Hah! With a pathetic country like this?

[caption #123]
<A4>: What brings Kefka, humble servant of Emperor Gestahl, into our lowly presence?<EOP>
Kefka: A girl of no importance recently escaped from us. We heard she found refuge here.

[caption #124]
<A4>: Hmm_ <D>this wouldn't have anything to do with this [witch] everyone's been whispering about, would it?<EOP>
Kefka: Not at all. She merely stole something of minor value. <D>Is she here?

[caption #125]
<A4>: That's a tough one!

[caption #126]
<A4>: You see, there are more girls in here than grains of sand out there. I can't keep track of all of them!<EOP>
Kefka: Oh, <A4>_ <D>I'd hate to be you if we found out you were lying.

[caption #127]
Kefka: It would truly be a tragedy if something were to happen to your precious Figaro.

[caption #128]
<A1>: I'd say that guy's a few suits shy of a full deck_<EOP>
<A4>: _where's <A0>?

[caption #129]
<A4>: Take her to her room.

[caption #130]
<A4>: I'd love to chat with you, but the chancellor and I must speak in private.<EOP>
<A4>: Sometimes I hate being a king! If you'll excuse me.

[caption #131]
<A1>: Follow me.

[caption #132]
<A1>: Sorry, I've dragged you around all this time without even introducing myself. I'm-<EOP>
<A0>: You're a thief. <A4> told me about you.

[caption #133]
<A1>: I'm a treasure hunter!

[caption #134]
<A1>: Anyway_ on the surface, <A4> pretends to support the Empire.<EOP>
<A1>: The truth is, he's collaborating with the Returners, an organization opposed to the Empire.<EOP>
<A1>: I am his contact with that group.

[caption #135]
<A1>: The old man you met in Narshe is one of us.<EOP>
<A0>: But_ <D>I'm a soldier of the Empire_

[caption #136]
<A1>: Not if you don't want to be. They were using you, <A0>. <D>Things are different now.

[caption #137]
<A0>: I don't understand_ <D>what should I do?

[caption #138]
<A1>: I can't tell you what to do. Your decisions are your own to make from now on. <D>It's up to you to find your own way.

[caption #139]
<A0>: _but how will I know which way is right?

[caption #140]
<A4>: _?<EOP>
<A4>: What the-

[caption #141]
<A4>: What's happening?<EOP>
Soldier: It's the Empire! It's Kefka!

[caption #142]
<A4>: What do you think you're doing?

[caption #143]
Kefka: Bring me the girl. Now!<EOP>
<A4>: I don't know what you're talking about!<EOP>
Kefka: Then welcome to my barbecue! Bwahaha!

[caption #144]
Fire!

[caption #145]
Fire! Fire! Heh heh heh_

[caption #146]
<A4>: Get ready!<EOP>
Soldier: Yes sir!

[caption #147]
Kefka: Changed your mind?

[caption #148]
<A4>: I guess I have no choice_

[caption #149]
<A4>: _or maybe I do!

[caption #150]
Kefka: Oh my! Shameful that a king should flee, leaving his people behind!<EOP>
Kefka: How_ <D>delightful!

[caption #151]
<A4>: Jump! <E$04><OP$12>

[caption #152]

[caption #153]
<A4>: Okay! Dive now!

[caption #154]
Figaro Submerge Mode engaged! <E$04><OP$12>

[caption #155]
No one can touch the people of Figaro!

[caption #156]
<A4>: Bravo, Figaro! <E$03><OP$12>

[caption #157]
Kefka: Go! Go! KILL THEM!

[caption #158]
Kefka: Son of a submariner! You'll pay for this, you spoony king!

[caption #159]
<A1>: That was great! <E$06><OP$12>

[caption #160]
<A0>: Was that evil man from the Empire? <E$04><OP$12>I_ <D>I'm scared_

[caption #161]
<A4>: <A0>, there's someone we'd like you to meet.

[caption #162]
<A1>: Like I said before, we're members of the Returners.<EOP>
<A4>: Our leader, Banon, would certainly like to meet you.<EOP>
<A4>: [Magic] is going to be the key to winning this war.

[caption #163]
<A0>: _

[caption #164]
<A4>: You seem to have some magical power. That esper_ <D>it reacted to you? There has to be a connection.<EOP>
<A0>: _I don't know. <D>It just comes naturally to me.

[caption #165]
<A4>: But no human is born with the powers you have!

[caption #166]
<A4>: I apologize.<EOP>
<A0>: _what should I do?<EOP>
<A4>: I'm sure the Empire is going to come after us.<EOP>
<A4>: They want your powers for their own, and if they get them the world is done for.<EOP>
<A4>: <A0>, you want to understand your own powers, right?

[caption #167]
<A4>: Then I think we need to meet with Banon.<EOP>
<A0>: _

[caption #168]
<A1>: Please, <A0>. Come with us.

[caption #169]
<A4>: There's a cave east of here that leads to South Figaro. Let's go.

[caption #170]
I'm sorry, but our king is in Figaro Castle.

[caption #171]
Soldier: King <A4>! Where are you headed, sire?<EOP>
<A4>: To South Figaro and then on to meet with Banon. Return to the castle and tell the others we're safe.<EOP>
Soldier: Understood, sire! Take care!

[caption #172]
Zzz_

There's a key in his pocket_
<C> (Take it)
<C> (Stealing is wrong)

[caption #174]
<C> (Wind the clock)
<C> (Ignore the clock)

[caption #175]
It's not ticking.

[caption #176]
It's ticking.

[caption #177]
Took the clock key!

[caption #178]
Welcome to South Figaro!

[caption #179]
Heading up into the mountains? Be sure to stock up on supplies.

[caption #180]
I heard that Figaro Castle sank into the desert.

[caption #181]
Mt. Kolts is to the northeast.

[caption #182]
Beyond Mt. Kolts lie the Sabil Mountains.

[caption #183]
I like relics! They're comfy and easy to wear!

[caption #184]
Sara: My husband, Duncan, is a world-famous martial artist.<EOP>
Sara: He took his disciples up to Mt. Kolts for meditation and training.

[caption #185]
Sara: <A5>! Where's Vargas? <D>_where's my husband?

[caption #186]
<A5>: Master was_ <D>Vargas killed him_

[caption #187]
Sara: I'll never understand Vargas_<EOP>
Sara: Duncan was right to teach his most secret techniques only to you.

[caption #188]
<A5>: For 10 years you've treated me like a son. I am eternally grateful.

[caption #189]
_

[caption #190]
<A1>: At the very least you could give us a response_

[caption #191]
<A4>: Wait, <A1>_ <D>he seems familiar_

[caption #192]
He owes allegiance to no one,
and will do anything for money.
He comes and goes like the wind_

[caption #193]
<A4>: That's <A3>, a ninja assassin. <D>He'd slit his mother's throat for 50 GP!

[caption #194]
<A1>: Better steer clear of him, I guess.

[caption #195]
<A3>: Leave us. The dog eats strangers.

[caption #196]
The guy at the counter is kinda creepy_

[caption #197]
That guy at the cou- hey! Where'd he go?

[caption #198]
You look just like one of Master Duncan's students.

[caption #199]
I'm so sorry to hear about Duncan.

[caption #200]
Duncan's always grumbling about how his son, Vargas, never seems to be making any progress in his training.

[caption #201]
The house in the northern part of town belongs to our wealthiest family.

[caption #202]
I hear the Empire's been invading one town after another. Are we safe here?

[caption #203]
You could at least buy me dinner first.

[caption #204]
The Empire will crush us!

[caption #205]
This town will go down fighting! Even with their Magitek Armor, we'll make it tough on 'em!

[caption #206]
[Attack from the east_]<EOP>
Hey! What do you think you're doing, barging in here while I'm trying to write a letter?

[caption #207]
Get out!

[caption #208]
What have I done? I betrayed the town, and I didn't even need the money!

[caption #209]
Derp.

[caption #210]
My dad's really important! He has drinks with General Leo!

[caption #211]
Legend says that if someone has been asleep for too long, a magical creature called a tapir appears to wake them up.<EOP>
(This happened in the original game, too - we didn't add it.)
-BTB

[caption #212]
Has war really begun?

[caption #213]
The Imperial troops have turned this house into their headquarters.

[caption #214]
There's always a draft in this room. Where's it coming from?

[caption #215]
Bring me some cider, and maybe I'll talk to you.

[caption #216]
No cider? <D>Asshole!

[caption #217]
Sieg heil!

[caption #218]
Ah, Cider! *glug* *glug*<EOP>
_huh? <D>Secret passage? <D>Sure, you can use it if you'd like.

[caption #219]
Just go downstairs and give my grandson the password.<EOP>
<A1>: Right_ <D>the password_

[caption #220]
My grandfather was a servant for the richest family in town.

[caption #221]
_you don't look like a merchant to me. <D>Get lost.

[caption #222]
Merchant, right? You may proceed.

[caption #223]
_you can't come in unless you give the password.<EOP>
<C> [Wild Rosebud]
<C> [Swordfish]
<C> [Password]

[caption #224]
You can't fool me! You're an Imperial spy!

[caption #225]
Here's the secret entrance.

[caption #226]
Good luck!

[caption #227]
This here is some of the best cider in the land. The secret is the fruit it's made from.<EOP>
They're harvested with sticks and must be boiled three times to remove all of the poison.<EOP>
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have a delivery to make.

[caption #228]
Piss off, you bloody wanker.

[caption #229]
Are kids allowed in here?

[caption #230]
Hey!

[caption #231]
Hands off my cider, thief!

[caption #232]

     Got [Cider]

[caption #233]
The ship isn't going anywhere.

[caption #234]
Imperial troops everywhere! Gotta get out without being seen!

[caption #235]
Was this trip really necessary? <D>Seriously, there was no good reason to come back this way.

[caption #236]
<A4>: _what's that smell?<EOP>
<A1>: Huh? <D>Oh. Sorry.<EOP>
<A4>: No, not you_ <D>something else.

[caption #237]
<A4>: These flowers_ <D>did he have favorite flowers?

[caption #238]
<A4>: His favorite tea_

Banon: Right.

Banon: Yes_ the ancient War of the Magi.

No! It can't be!

[caption #343]
<A1>: My grandma used to tell me stories about magical machines_ were they true?

[caption #344]
<A4>: Could that ancient tragedy be playing out once again_?<EOP>
Banon: It's just speculation, and historical studies have provided a number of conflicting stories.<EOP>
Banon: But according to one theory, both humans and machines were infused with powers drained from espers.

[caption #345]
<A0>: That's what Magitek power is_?

[caption #346]
<A4>: We can only fight magic with magic.

[caption #347]
Banon: Out of the question! That would bring about another War of the Magi!<EOP>
<A4>: Then what do you propose?<EOP>
Banon: We return to Narshe_ <D>and see if we can't have a chat with an esper.<EOP>
<A4>: You want to_ <D>talk to the esper?<EOP>
Banon: If we can get it to react to <A0> again, we may just be able to wake it.<EOP>

This is a classroom for the beginner_ <D>and unless you've played this mod before, that means you.<EOP>
Please, speak with everyone here and heed their advice.

[caption #599]
It should go without saying, but talk to everyone that you meet.<EOP>
What you're doing right now? That's good. Keep doing it.

[caption #600]
Stat gains are no longer tied to character levels, so there is no advantage to keeping them low early in the game.<EOP>
You don't need to min-max to beat this mod, and there really is no [wrong] way to build your characters.<EOP>
_so just have fun, 'eh?

[caption #601]
This here is a genuine replica save point (there was no room left in the code for a real one).<EOP>
Save points let you save your game_ <D>and that's it.<EOP>
Tents don't exist in this game, so healing items are important to keep handy.<EOP>
There do exist [restore points], which fully heal your party in addition to letting you save, but they're much less common.<EOP>
Save often because, should you die in battle, it's back to the title screen with you - there are no more mulligans.

[caption #602]
There's an option in the config menu to disable exp. gains if you don't want to overlevel. In return, GP gain will be doubled.<EOP>
Please don't just leave it on all the time and then bitch to us about how hard the game is.

[caption #603]
Dried Meat is cheap and vital to keeping you alive early on.<EOP>
Tonics and Potions restore fractions of your max HP, so they're more useful later on.

[caption #604]
It used to be that some chests would have better loot if you waited until later in the game to open them.<EOP>
We thought that was stupid, so now they don't.

[caption #605]
When outfitting your party, remember that most equipment does more now than just boost raw defense or battle power.<EOP>
Hold Â± when shopping to view the full stats of any item prior to purchase.<EOP>
Equipment can be also reviewed in the item menu: press $ twice for info and use @/& to switch views.<EOP>
Note that while stat boosts from equipment will stack, other properties (including HP/MP boosts) will not.

[caption #606]
Only use the [Steal] command on foes who might be holding something, namely those of the human variety.<EOP>
If successful, [hunting for treasure] will not consume <A1>'s turn.<EOP>
The chance of success - as well as the odds of getting better loot - rise with <A1>'s speed.

[caption #607]
Evasion rates vary from foe to foe; faster ones are better at it while slower opponents are not able to dodge at all.<EOP>
Meanwhile, many magical attacks can be avoided with either m.evade or stamina, depending on the attack.<EOP>
All enemies possess at least some stamina (depending on their max HP), but m.evade is exclusive to your characters.

[caption #608]
Many battles may seem overwhelming at first, but can be easily - and quickly - dealt with by altering your strategy.<EOP>
Observe enemy behavior and learn whether it's better to attack directly or to disable them before they can hurt you.<EOP>
Some foes, for example, will only become aggressive once they have taken damage or if they are alone.<EOP>
Certain types of enemies will counter close-range physical attacks, even as a dying move. Enemy reactions will be shown in yellow.<EOP>
Larger foes and bosses may counter ANY kind of damage, so be careful when attacking with a weakened character.<EOP>
Finally, hitting an elemental weakness can sometimes have additional effects on enemies beyond the extra damage dealt.

[caption #609]
Hold down Â£ and { to run from battles that get out of hand.<EOP>
Faster characters like <A1> are better at getting away quickly than others are.<EOP>
Also, you can view your party's maximum HP values in battle by holding }`.

[caption #610]
Press ^ or Â± in battle to [hold] an active character's turn and cycle to the next available ally.<EOP>
When a command is input, there will be a delay until it executes indicated by the ATB gauge counting down.<EOP>
This feature can be disabled in the config menu if you find it distracting.

[caption #611]
Press Â£ or { to select multiple targets for any spell with no targeting restrictions, such as
<A0>'s Fire and Cure spells.<EOP>
Other commands with [free] targeting are [Throw] (with stars) and [GP Toss].<EOP>
The damage (or healing) dealt by anything split in this manner will be reduced by 50%.<EOP>
This [split] penalty also applies to some attacks that hit more than one enemy by default, such as elemental ninja scrolls.

[caption #612]
You can change which row each character occupies (default is front) by pressing $ twice on a portrait.<EOP>
Characters in the back row take less damage from physical attacks and deal less damage with their own.<EOP>
This penalty affects physical damage from special skills such as [Bushido], as well as spells randomly cast from weapons.<EOP>
Some weapons do full damage from the back row, as will the [Throw]/[GP Toss] commands or [Jump] with any weapon.<EOP>
Characters can change row in battle by pressing @. This is a [quick] action that only uses half of a turn.<EOP>
Press & to [Defend], which halves all damage until another command is input (note: this is also a [quick] action).<EOP>
Defending characters are more likely to guard (healthy) allies if able, but will lose their defense bonus when they do so.

[caption #613]
The [stamina] attribute helps you evade status ailments set by enemy attacks and avoid certain attacks altogether.<EOP>
A [fail] message is displayed whenever stamina prevents a negative status. If the target is immune, it will say [null].<EOP>
Stamina also raises the HP recovery from [Regen] and lowers the drain from [Sap].<EOP>
Several abilities, such as the Remedy and Regen spells or the Aurabolt Blitz, now use stamina to determine their strength_<EOP>
_and it also affects the frequency of counterattacks and/or guarding allies for characters who can do so.<EOP>
Finally, stamina helps you take lower - and more consistent - damage from magical attacks.<EOP>
The [vigor] attribute does the same thing for physical damage taken (in addition to governing physical damage dealt).

[caption #614]
Spears and some relics allow characters to guard their allies from physical attacks, but only while standing in the front row.<EOP>
Allies at critical HP will always be defended; allies in the back row will be blocked at random regardless of their health.<EOP>
The higher a character's stamina, the more likely he or she is to protect healthy allies.

[caption #615]
Katanas and spears can be used with two hands to increase their battle power by 50%.<EOP>
Claws, knives, and some other weapons allow the use of a second weapon.<EOP>
Using two weapons will cause the damage output of both to be reduced by 25%.<EOP>
Gauntlet? <D>Genji Glove? <D>What in blazes are those? <D>Are you on the dope, son?

[caption #616]
Status effects work differently here than they did before, as I'm sure you may have noticed.<EOP>
[Blind] actually works now, and it even affects the accuracy of skills that normally can't miss like [Blitz] and [Bushido].<EOP>
[Imp] is now a 50% nerf to all output (damage AND healing).<EOP>
Weaker statuses like [Blind] and [Imp] are a safe bet for disabling foes since they're very uncommonly resisted.<EOP>
[Sleep], [Muddle], and [Berserk] are stronger choices since they will completely override enemy behavior.<EOP>
[Remedy] (the spell or item) will remove ALL bad statuses except for [Sap] and [Zombie].<EOP>
[Zombie] is a special kind of instant death that must be cured with [Holy Water].<EOP>
[Sap] can only be remedied by setting the [Regen] status.

[caption #617]
Want to walk faster?
Just hold down \.<EOP>
You can also set it as the default movement speed in the config menu.

[caption #618]
[Slow] and [Sap] aren't very crippling statuses, but they usually work - particularly against bosses.<EOP>
[Haste] and [Regen] are their opposite effects; setting one will cancel out the other.<EOP>
Having any of the above statuses inherent will grant immunity to its counterpart.<EOP>
If you're ever unsure, the [Scan] spell will display all statuses on a foe - and won't consume the caster's turn.

[caption #619]
Statuses affecting speed are indicated by color changes to a character's ATB bar.<EOP>
Green  = [Haste]
Yellow = [Slow]
Red     = [Stop]<EOP>
Glowing auras surrounding a character indicate defensive statuses (if more than one is present, they will cycle).<EOP>
Yellow = [Safe]
Green  = [Shell]
Blue    = [Reflect]<EOP>
[Safe] and [Shell] raise your defense against physical and magical attacks, respectively.<EOP>
[Reflect] repels most magical attacks that don't forcibly aim for more than one target, but may break when it does so.<EOP>
It also does not work on spells randomly cast from weapons or [Reflected] off another target.

[caption #620]
Characters with the [Rerise] status will be immediately revived if they die in battle.<EOP>
You can check for it and/or the [Regen]/[Sap] statuses by targeting your party with a spell or item.

[caption #621]
[Image] and [Clear] render it impossible for physical attacks to hit you.<EOP>
Magic never misses invisible targets, however, and getting hit removes the status.<EOP>
[Image] on the other hand, has a chance to wear off for every attack it cancels out.

[caption #622]
[Runic] absorbs ANY standard magic spell - basically, anything that starts with a white, black, or grey dot.<EOP>
These dots are also a clue as to which foes can be disabled with the [Rasp] or [Mute] spells.

[caption #623]
Using [Rage] causes you to take on all attributes of an enemy, including status and elemental resistances/weaknesses.<EOP>
This includes the [undead] trait and all of the benefits - and drawbacks - that go with it.<EOP>
The undead are immune to most status effects, and many things (like [Doom]) actually have the opposite effect on them.<EOP>
Because their existence is magically sustained, however, an easy way to kill them is to deplete their MP.

[caption #624]
Somewhere in this world is an [advanced] school with more knowledge to share.

[Jump] is more powerful than [Fight], and it does even more damage if a spear is equipped (for best results, use 2 hands).<EOP>
It also increases the damage of spells that are randomly cast from certain weapons.<EOP>
Rods consume MP when you [Fight] (not [Jump]) with them for an even greater boost to their random spellcasts.<EOP>
Just remember that your row affects the damage of random spellcasts when using [Fight] instead of [Jump].

Equipped espers may be summoned once per battle by pressing <$74> on the [Magic] menu.<EOP>
Magic is learned from espers by spending [spell points], which characters earn from fighting battles with an esper equipped.<EOP>
Characters also gain [esper points] (EP) when they earn spell points and exp. from the same battle.<EOP>
Esper points earn [esper levels] (EL), which are used to grant permanent stat boosts from espers.<EOP>
Esper levels are not applied automatically after gaining them, but are rather [banked] just like spell points are.<EOP>
Banked ELs are spent just like spell points - go to the esper menu and then click on the EL bonus for that esper.<EOP>
The yellow value next to each stat on the status screen indicates how much it has been raised by ELs.<EOP>
Espers also grant temporary bonuses while they're equipped just like equipment would.<EOP>
For example, Kirin raises magic power while equipped, but will permanently raise stamina and HP for each EL spent on it.<EOP>
Finally, just like weapons and armor, not every esper can be used by every character. See the printme for more info.

[Morph] lasts until manually reverted or until you die.<EOP>
It boosts all damage and healing output by 50%, but it doubles all damage taken in return.<EOP>
This penalty can be lowered by raising <A0>'s stamina.

[caption #629]
Exploit elemental weaknesses for best win in battle. Humans, for example, are especially vulnerable to [dark] damage.<EOP>
Bolt and water are most effective against mechanical enemies. Bolt also works very well on anything that flies.<EOP>
And while ice may not be one of the more powerful elements, it still killed the dinosaurs.<EOP>
Earth and wind are very strong on the other hand, but no foes have a weakness to them.<EOP>
Fractional damage in particular is effective against any enemy that doesn't resist its element and isn't a boss.<EOP>
Holy-elemental spells (including curative ones) are best used on the undead for major damage.<EOP>
And if all else fails, use fire.

[caption #630]
Weapons and/or shields can be swapped in battle by pressing <$74> in the [Item] menu.<EOP>
Doing so will consume half a turn for one hand; changing both requires a full turn.

[War of the Magi_]

[caption #1096]
Ramuh: It took place long ago_<EOP>
Ramuh: Espers fought what are known today as Magitek Knights, created from magical power extracted from espers.

[caption #1097]
Ramuh: After that pointless war, we espers feared our powers would once again become targeted and abused.<EOP>
Ramuh: To allay these fears, we fashioned a new realm and moved there.

[caption #1098]
Ramuh: About 20 years ago, humans stumbled upon the entrance to that realm.<EOP>
Ramuh: Humans who knew about espers, and the secret to Magitek power. <E$18><OP$12>

[caption #1099]
Ramuh: Thus began a hunt for espers. Gestahl planned to use our power to create an army without equal.<E$18><OP$12>

Gestahl: As you may know, Kefka has been imprisoned for the poisoning of Doma. What should become of him?

[caption #1775]
<C> [Leave him in jail.]
<C> [Pardon him.]
<C> [Execute him.]

[caption #1776]
<A4>: Head south to Albrook. We'll take care of things here.

[caption #1777]
<A5>: Can we really trust the Empire? I have a bad feeling about this_

<A2>: Never will I be able to forgive Kefka_

[caption #1779]

[caption #1780]
<A10>: So, how do you like the mod so far? Having fun, kupo?

[caption #1781]
Gestahl: General Leo is waiting for you in Albrook.

[caption #1782]
Gestahl: In any event, I believe it best to let him stew in his cell for a while. <D>We can decide his fate later.

[caption #1783]
<C> [Why did you start the war?]
<C> [Why do you want peace?]
<C> [What's up with your men?]

[caption #1784]
Gestahl: My foolish lust for power drove me to do it all. <D>I've now come to my senses.

[caption #1785]
Gestahl: In our current situation, I feel it is imperative that we unite your power with the Empire's.

[caption #1786]
Gestahl: Some of my men refuse to embrace peace. I felt they'd understand if they met you face to face.

[caption #1787]
Gestahl: With your permission, I'd like to move on to discussing the espers_

[caption #1788]
<C> [I have another question.]
<C> [Okay.]

[caption #1789]
<C> [One more question, please.]
<C> [Let's talk about the espers.]

[caption #1790]
Gestahl: I assure you, I have answered your questions truthfully.

[caption #1791]
Gestahl: My Empire has been decimated by the espers that emerged from the sealed gate.<EOP>
Gestahl: They're simply too powerful. If we leave them be, they may tear the world asunder.

[caption #1792]
<C> [Yes, they are a danger.]
<C> [_but YOU unleashed them!]

[caption #1793]
Gestahl: When the espers embarked on their rampage, all of my ambition faded instantly.<EOP>
Gestahl: I knew I couldn't go on with my war.<EOP>
Gestahl: Now I find myself asking why I ever desired that much power in the first place.<EOP>
Gestahl: By the way_ <D>about those questions you asked me, which did you ask first?

[caption #1794]
Gestahl: Yes, of course. I'm a bit weary it seems_ <D>perhaps a brief recess from conversation would be in order.

[caption #1795]
Cid: Care to take a break?

[caption #1796]
<C> [Yes, let's take a break.]
<C> [Let's keep talking.]

Shall we resume?

We wish to test your strength in battle. Do you accept?
<C> [Sure]
<C> [Sorry]

Well done_

[caption #1804]
Gestahl: I understand. My only desire is peace. And now, I have a favor to ask_

Gestahl: I have ordered this war to end. There will be no more fighting. And now, I have a favor to ask_

Gestahl: I am truly sorry for what I've done. <D>And now, I have a favor to ask_

[caption #1807]
Gestahl: After they devastated the Empire, the espers headed north toward Crescent Island.<EOP>
Gestahl: They must be found before they strike again. We must seek them out and reach an accord.<EOP>
Gestahl: After all that the Empire has put them through, we likely won't reach a solution if we go alone.<EOP>
Gestahl: That is why_ <D>I need <A0>'s help.

[caption #1808]
Cid: If anyone can bridge the gap between esper and human, it's <A0>.

<A2>: <D>The fault lieth not with thee_

<A1>: If <A0> goes, I'll go.

[caption #1818]
<A0>: <A1>_ <D>thank you.

[caption #1819]
<A1>: The rest of you wait here. I smell a rat_

[caption #1820]
<A4>: As do I. It's hard to trust the Emperor just like that.

[caption #1821]
<A2>: We shall remain here and watch for signs that mark the extraordinary.<EOP>
<A4>: _does he ALWAYS talk like this?<EOP>
<A5>: Yeah, pretty much.

[caption #1822]
<A1>: Thanks. Stay frosty, everyone_ no telling what Gestahl has up his sleeve.

[caption #1823]
<A4>: Y'all be careful too. Leo seems trustworthy, but he's still a soldier of the Empire_

[caption #1824]
Gestahl: I truly apologize for the poisoning of Doma. No one dreamed that Kefka would sink that low.

[caption #1825]
<C> [What's done is done.]
<C> [That, we can't forgive.]
<C> [Apologize again!]

<C> [She was an Imperial spy?]

Cid: You know, if you took the casino out of the ship's belly, you could drastically increase its speed_

[caption #2007]
<A7>: Save your thanks for these people.<EOP>
<A8>: Thank you for saving me.

[caption #2008]
<A7>: I guess our town's little secret is out now_

[caption #2009]
<A1>: Everyone in this village can use magic, can't they? <D>What is this place?

[caption #2010]
<A7>: This is_ <D>one of the last remaining villages of sorcerers.

[caption #2011]
<A7>: Long ago humans used magicite to gain magical powers.<EOP>
<A7>: They came to be known as sorcerers.

[caption #2012]
<A1>: But I thought they died out centuries ago.

[caption #2013]
<A7>: After the War of the Magi, the espers fled to their new realm behind the sealed gate.<EOP>
<A7>: They wished to live peacefully, without fear of being used by humans.<EOP>
<A7>: They left us here to fend for ourselves.<EOP>
<A7>: Normal people feared and despised sorcerers' power.<EOP>
<A7>: The horror of the war was still fresh in their minds.

[caption #2014]
<A7>: It soon turned into an inquisition. We were hunted down like animals. <D>There weren't even any trials_<EOP>
<A0>: Even though the only difference was that sorcerers could use magic_?

[caption #2015]
<A7>: Some sorcerers managed to escape the genocidal hunts.<EOP>
<A7>: Many of the survivors founded villages where others could hide safely. <D>But the raids didn't stop.<EOP>
<A7>: Villages found to be sheltering sorcerers were put to the torch, their inhabitants murdered.<EOP>
<A7>: For those hateful enough to desire the sorcerers' extinction, simple accusations were enough.<EOP>
<A7>: They leveled even those villages that turned us away.

[caption #2016]
<A0>: That's terrible_<EOP>
<A7>: Thamasa somehow managed to survive the massacres, though we still forbid the use of magic.<EOP>
<A7>: Our powers have weakened over time, but some of it remains.<EOP>
<A1>: Well_ <D>if you're up to it, we could use your help.<EOP>
<A7>: You said you were after the espers, right?

[caption #2017]
<A7>: Well, I owe you for saving <A8>. <D>I'll help you find your espers.

[caption #2018]
<A8>: I want to go too!<EOP>
<A7>: Not a chance, young lady.

[caption #2019]
<A8>: Hmph, mean old jackass!

[caption #2020]
<A1>: But where do we start looking?<EOP>
<A7>: Hmm_ <D>if they came this way, they may be hiding in the mountains to the west.

[caption #2021]
<A1>: Why there?<EOP>
<A7>: Those mountains have powerful magical properties. According to legend, it's a holy land to the espers.

[caption #2022]
<A0>: Perhaps the magic of that place drew them there_

[caption #2023]
<A1>: I think it's worth a look.

[caption #2024]
<A7>: When you left, I thought you weren't coming back.<EOP>
<A3>: Don't get the wrong idea. <D>I just wanted my dog back.

<A7>: H-hey_

<A0>: It wouldn't hurt to have her along, would it?

[caption #2031]
<A7>: Oh my_ <D>I don't believe it! These idols_ <D>they represent the Warring Triad!<EOP>
<A1>: The Warring Triad? Where have I heard that term before_?

[caption #2032]
The Birth of Magic<EOP>
Three dissonant goddesses descended upon this realm. Their constant fighting eventually led to all-out war.<EOP>
Those humans caught in the fray were transformed into espers and used as living implements of war.

[caption #2033]
<A1>: There's something carved on the back_

[caption #2034]
<A1>: Say, old man, what else can you tell us about this Warring Triad?

[caption #2035]
<A7>: According to legend, long ago they brought the power of magic into this world.<EOP>
<A1>: So, they're the goddesses of magic, then?<EOP>
<A7>: That's one way to put it.

[caption #2036]
<A0>: This place is teeming with some kind of power_<EOP>
<A7>: The Warring Triad - that is, the goddesses these idols represent - are the source of all magic.<EOP>
<A7>: Legend has it that the espers crafted these idols in the image of the goddesses and hid them away.<EOP>
<A7>: The idols represent incomprehensible power. I never fathomed that they would be here.

[caption #2037]
<A0>: Our espers were no doubt drawn to this island by this immense magical power_

[caption #2038]
Eventually, the goddesses realized that their foolish war would never end.<EOP>
In a rare moment of mutual clarity, they agreed to end the fighting and seal themselves off from the rest of the world.<EOP>
The victims of their senseless war, the espers, were granted free will, and the goddesses entered their stone sleep.<EOP>
Their only request of the espers was to keep them sealed away for all time.

[caption #2039]
These idols were created as a symbol of our vow to let the goddesses sleep peacefully for eternity.

[caption #2040]
<A1>: That's_ <D>quite a story.<EOP>
<A0>: If the espers were attracted here by these idols, they must be nearby!

[caption #2041]
<A1>: So, what exactly happened to these goddesses?<EOP>
<A7>: The carvings on the backs of the idols should tell the whole story.<EOP>
<A7>: In short, they were turned to stone and hidden away, out of the reach of humans.<EOP>
<A7>: My best guess would be that they're beyond the Sealed Gate.

[caption #2042]
<A0>: I wonder if the barrier that protects the esper world is sustained by the Warring Triad?

[caption #2043]
<A8>: Are these_ <D>espers?

[caption #2044]
<A0>: I had no idea there would be this many_<EOP>
<A1>: Gramps, take <A8> and get out of here!

[caption #2045]
<A7>: What are they doing?

[caption #2046]
Wait!

[caption #2047]
<A8>: What is it?<EOP>
<A7>: I sense_ <D>immense magical power in <A0>.<EOP>
<A7>: No_ <D>it's more than just magic_

[caption #2048]
<A1>: <A0>! Stay with us! We can't have you going ballistic again!

[caption #2049]
Esper: My name is Yura. <D>I sense a familiar aura radiating from you_ <D>you're different from the others, aren't you?<EOP>
<A0>: Yes_

[caption #2050]
<A7>: You're the espers that fled through the Sealed Gate?<EOP>
Yura: Normally, we are forbidden from entering this world, but we wanted to help those that had been captured_<EOP>
Yura: We few had gathered near the gate, wondering what we could do to save them.<EOP>
Yura: Just then, she appeared_

[caption #2051]
<A0>: I could feel your presence through the gate.<EOP>
Yura: We entered this world the moment the gate was opened.<EOP>
Yura: But when we crossed that threshold, we lost control of our powers.

[caption #2052]
Yura: We leveled an entire city, and killed those who'd done no wrong_

[caption #2053]
<A0>: The same thing happened to me. The moment that power stirred inside me, I had no control over it_

[caption #2054]
<A7>: I wonder_ is there something in your world that dampens your power?<EOP>
<A7>: Then, freed from your reins upon entering this world, your powers ran wild_ or maybe_

[caption #2055]
Yura: Whatever the case may be, it seems even we espers can lose our minds and commit unspeakable acts_<EOP>
Yura: We would beg your forgiveness.

[caption #2056]
<A1>: The Empire seems to want to talk peace with you. Why not come with us?<EOP>
Yura: _they would forgive us so easily?

[caption #2057]
<A1>: They should. They have committed far worse crimes to your kind.<EOP>
<A1>: Let's head to Thamasa and meet with General Leo.

[caption #2058]
<A1>: General Leo.<EOP>
Leo: <A1>, welcome back. And you've found the espers! I owe you a debt of gratitude.

[caption #2059]
Leo: I am Leo, a general of the Empire. <D>Might I ask your name?<EOP>
Yura: I am called Yura.

[caption #2060]
Yura: What we have done to your people is inexcusable.<EOP>
Yura: We are in no position to ask your forgiveness, but_

[caption #2061]
Leo: Speak no further. It is we who should beg your forgiveness.<EOP>
Leo: We thought of you only as a means by which to wage war.<EOP>
Leo: How close we came to bringing about a second War of the Magi.<EOP>
Yura: We must put this all behind us.

Cid: *cough* *hack* _while I can still talk, I_ *wheeze* *pant* _want to thank you_

[caption #2186]
Cid: I have something I want to show you_<EOP>
<A6>: What's that?<EOP>
Cid: Have a look downstairs. It's something I've been working on for the last year.

<A6>: Granddad_ you have to eat, or- <D>_wh-what's the matter?

[caption #2188]
<A6>: Cid_

[caption #2189]
<A6>: No_ no! You promised you'd stay here with me!

<A6>: Cid_ Granddad_!

[caption #2192]
Cid: You must leave this place, <A6>. You have to find your friends!<EOP>
<A6>: You're_ <D>not coming?<EOP>
Cid: No_ <D>I should stay here. <D>I've done too much to help bring about the destruction of this world.<EOP>
<A6>: Granddad_<EOP>
Cid: I've no more right to live amongst people than Kefka.<EOP>
<A6>: <D>_I'll bring everyone back to meet you.<EOP>
Cid: So long as you promise to bring along that <A1> fellow.<EOP>
<A6>: It's a deal.

[caption #2193]
<A6>: I'll make you proud of me, Granddad_

[caption #2194]
Cid: One by one, they threw themselves from the northern cliffs_

[caption #2195]
<A6>: Everyone's gone_ <D>even the man who promised to protect me until the end of the world.<EOP>
<A6>: And now_ <D>it really is the end of the world_<EOP>
<A6>: I asked you to let me protect you for once, <A1>_ <D>and I failed. <D>I guess war really is all I'm good for_<EOP>
<A6>: I couldn't even save Granddad_<EOP>
<A6>: Everything around me is either dying or dead. <D>There's nothing left_ <D>nobody left.

<A6>: Could it be_? <D>Is <A1> still alive?<EOP>
<A6>: <D>_I've got to find a way off this island.

[caption #2199]
You must leave this island. Somewhere out there, your friends are waiting for you.<EOP>
There are stairs behind the stove. Down there you will find your road to freedom.
           Love, Granddad

[caption #2200]
Thank you so much for your help.<EOP>
_looking for your friends?
Head north on the Serpent Trench and you'll reach Nikeah. You should find out more there.

[caption #2201]
I was on lookout duty for Kefka_ <D>not that there's anything I could've done_

[caption #2202]
Anyone who defies the almighty Kefka is doomed.<EOP>
He uses his Light of Judgment from high atop his tower to devastate entire towns.

[caption #2203]
I saw it! Kefka used a beam of light to burn the village of Mobliz, to the east.<EOP>
Most of the adults there died trying to save their children_

[caption #2204]
The Serpent Trench used to be deep under water. Now it's above sea level.<EOP>
Some weirdos calling themselves the [Cult of Kefka] have built a tower there.

[caption #2205]
Ever since the world fell apart, all sorts of things have been washing ashore on the world's beaches.<EOP>
Most of it is junk, but you can sometimes find some really good stuff.

[caption #2206]
Mobliz is to the east along the Serpent Trench_ or what's left of it, anyway.<EOP>
Kefka's Light of Judgment really torched that place.

[caption #2207]
I saw a mudcrab the other day_ <D>horrible creatures.<EOP>
I avoid them whenever I can.

[caption #2208]
I'm scared!

[caption #2209]
My child's inside! Someone, please do something!

[caption #2210]
Someone must've pissed off Kefka_

[caption #2211]
Monsters are inside!

[caption #2212]
Kefka unleashed his Light of Judgment on us!

[caption #2213]
Hurry, before the house collapses!

<A5>: <A6>! Get in there, quick!<EOP>
<A6>: _?

<A5>: Get in there, quick!

[caption #2222]
<A6>: I thought everyone was dead_ <D>I had given up all hope_<EOP>
<A6>: But I can't give up now, can I? They might all still be alive. <D>And once we find everyone_

[caption #2223]
[Come on, we've got work to do!]

[caption #2224]
<A5>: Yeah, I know. We smash Kefka and fight for everlasting peace!

Won't you please help us?
<C> Yes
<C> Yes

[caption #2226]
Go back inside!

[caption #2227]
I'm scared!<EOP>
[Come on, let's go!]

[caption #2228]
On that day, debris from all over the world floated to the center of this continent and formed that tower_

[caption #2229]
Almighty Kefka is up there, using the power of the Warring Triad to strike down all who oppose him.

[caption #2230]
Everything changed on that day_

[caption #2231]
Anyone who opposes Lord Kefka gets their town torched by the Light of Judgment.

[caption #2232]
They say that the sea is red these days because Leviathan is angry_

[caption #2233]
Steer clear of the deserts when you travel - 'tis nary a man that could stand the likes of what be there.

[caption #2234]
Many long-sealed monsters were released when the world was ripped apart, among which were eight legendary dragons.<EOP>
Myths speak of a ninth dragon, the king of them all, that wielded ultimate power.<EOP>
According to legend, that power could only be contained by the elements represented by the other dragons.<EOP>
Each element in succession would delay the release of the dragon king's power, but would also add to it.<EOP>
That stored energy could then only be purged by a neutral force after enough time had passed for it to weaken.<EOP>
Were the power of too many elements to be absorbed too quickly, it would be unleashed before that could happen.

[caption #2235]
There's a demon roaming the skies, killing anyone that looks at it. Folks call it [Doom Gaze].

[caption #2236]
Some big guy came through here recently. Said he was looking for his friends.<EOP>
You sort of match a description he gave. He said he was heading north to Tzen.

[caption #2237]
Many monsters these days can inflict nasty conditions. Gotta keep yourself protected when you're wandering about.

[caption #2238]
I think back on how nice the world used to be_

[caption #2239]
_and then I realize it'll never be the same again. <D>*Sigh*

<A8>: Hey, you old bastard! You're still alive?

[caption #2241]
<A7>: <A8>! Is that you, my dear? <D>You're alive!

[caption #2242]
<A8>: Of course I'm alive!<EOP>
<A7>: Oh_ I'm so happy_<EOP>
<A8>: Did you think I was gonna check out before you, dumbass?

<C> [Sure, sounds legit.]
<C> [Piss off.]

[caption #2248]

   Got the magicite [Alexander]

[caption #2249]
No use talking to them. They've sold their souls to Kefka. <D>Probably their minds, too.<EOP>
They call themselves the [Kult of Kefka], and I hear they've got some mystical artifact locked up in this tower.<EOP>
Good luck if you're going in after it, though - their leader is some kind of grand wizard.<EOP>
Unless you're a master of elemental magic, you won't stand a chance.

Duane: You can't take <A0> away from us!

Katarin: Duane_<EOP>
Katarin: Please forgive him. It's just that if <A0> goes, we lose the only thing holding this village together.

[caption #2263]
<A0>: I don't know why these kids need me_ <D>but they've made me feel things I've never felt before.<EOP>
<A0>: The moment that feeling took root inside of me, I lost the power to fight.

[caption #2264]
<A0>: I can honestly say I don't know what's going on inside of me_<EOP>
<A0>: And the more I try to understand it, the more that power fails me.

The road you followed here used to be under water.

After the world ended, I woke up all alone in Doma Castle.<EOP>
When I tried to sleep there, demons came into my dreams and- <D>oh, God, it was horrible!

While moving under the desert, Figaro Castle hit something and came to a halt.<EOP>
I wonder what's down there_?

Mooks: Do we ever!

Gerad: Good. You lead the way. I'll take point once we're in.

[caption #2334]
These guys seem kinda shady_

[caption #2335]
From out of nowhere a bunch of huge sandworms burrowed into the prison!<EOP>
We followed their tunnels back to the surface and escaped.

[caption #2336]
Our last boss died that day. We met up with Gerad in this town.

[caption #2337]
The boss wants to sneak into Figaro Castle to get our booty back from the basement there.

[caption #2338]
We'll enter da castle through a secret cave dat only we knows about!

Gerad: Listen milady, it grieves me to disappoint such a beauty, but I've been [Gerad] since the day I was born.

<A5>: How can you tell?<EOP>

The Figaro Desert is home to some pretty nasty creatures these days.

Figaro Castle malfunctioned under the desert and got stuck there. I wonder if its people are okay_

People have been drinking a lot more these days.

Well, on the bright side, at least the Empire is gone.

Some days I don't even know why I bother_<EOP>
The things I've done in the last year_ <D>God, I feel so dirty.

There's no use in moping around, so we're staying busy!

<A6>: Why the farce, <A4>?<EOP>
<A4>: I heard that Figaro had an accident. I had to help, but how was I supposed to get to a castle stuck beneath the sand?<EOP>
<A4>: Then I heard that those idiots had escaped from the prison, so I knew there had to be a way back in.<EOP>
<A4>: I just needed them to lead me to it, but I couldn't let them know who I was.<EOP>
<A6>: Because you're the one who jailed them in the first place.<EOP>
<A4>: Yeah, I'm a bit surprised that worked, to be honest_ <D>these guys really aren't the brightest bunch.

[caption #2387]
<A5>: Well don't that just beat all_ you played 'em like a bunch of saps.<EOP>
<A4>: Yeah_ <D>you still owe me a new turtle, by the way.<EOP>

Bought a new stairway lamp at the item shop. Expensive, but it really lights up the place.<EOP>
I also aquired a strange, glowing rock from the owner of the colosseum up north to settle his debt.<EOP>
It was against my better judgment, but I grow weary of threatening him and he assured me it has great value.<EOP>
He tells me that it houses the spirit of a goddess. I intend to use it as a paperweight.
